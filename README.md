# 2nd_Project
The idea behind this website:-

<p>The name of my NGO is <b>PetUs</b>. And we protect street animals from getting any kind of harm and and give them shelter and food. But we all need family to love and 
to be loved. So our organisation provide families to these Loving animals. Those who want pets contact us and they can buy one and even if they can not afford 
to buy they can simply adopt them because providing them families is more important than anything. When any customer contact us to buy or adopt a pet we do the 
complete enquiry of them before giving them our one family member. And we check on them timt to time to see if they are happy or healthy.</p>
